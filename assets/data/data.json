    "text": "Austria Finance Minister Hartwig Löger is urging both his country and the broader European Union to treat cryptocurrencies such as bitcoin in a regulatory fashion as they do now with regard to gold and derivatives.  His proposals would further empower the country’s Money Laundering Registration Office of the Federal Criminal Police Office in identifying holders of crypto, placing exchanges under the auspices of the FMA. Mr. Löger’s comments were not fixated solely on bitcoin, however, as he also addressed initial coin offerings (ICOs). All ICOs would be subject to registration requirements and would be required to offer something like a “digital prospectus.",

    "text": "The Ministry of Finance in Kazakhstan has announced measures to improve security and oversight in its IT department after catching four employees mining cryptocurrencies on its servers. Joking that the miners have taken over the central bank’s main duty – money emission, a deputy called for crypto regulations. The National Bank is actually working on proposals to regulate the crypto sector. IT specialists working for the Finance Ministry in four different regions of Kazakhstan have been implicated in using government hardware to mine cryptocurrencies. They were employed by local offices of the ministry’s Department of State Revenue, investigators said, quoted by Tengrinews. The miners have been exploiting the servers of the tax authority and the most powerful personal computers available to employees.",

    "text": "Privacy is the revolutionary virtue that caused American colonists to slam the door in the face of British officials, both literally and figuratively. The Third Amendment of the U.S. Constitution prohibits the then-widespread practice of quartering soldiers in private homes, even during peace time, without the consent of owners. The Amendment sounds antiquated to modern ears.

It follows the First Amendment (freedom of speech and religion) and the Second Amendment (the right to bear arms.<br>",
